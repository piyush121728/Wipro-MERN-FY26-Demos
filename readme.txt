Scenario Background You are working as a Database Developer for EduPro Learning, 
a university that wants to manage its course enrollments, students, and instructors efficiently. 
The current data is stored in spreadsheets, and you have been asked to design a normalized database schema,
populate it with data, and write queries to generate reports for the academic department.

User Stories and Tasks 

User Story 1 — Database Design & Normalization As a database developer, I need to design a database schema that 
eliminates redundancy and maintains data integrity. 

Tasks: Analyze the following unstructured dataset: StudentIDﾠStudentNameﾠCourseNameﾠInstructorNameﾠDepartmentﾠGrade 

S101ﾠAsha GuptaﾠDatabase SystemsﾠDr. MehtaﾠComputer ScienceﾠA 
S102ﾠRaj VermaﾠData StructuresﾠDr. SharmaﾠComputer ScienceﾠB 
S101ﾠAsha GuptaﾠData StructuresﾠDr. SharmaﾠComputer ScienceﾠA 

Apply normalization (up to Third Normal Form - 3NF) and 

design separate tables: Student(StudentID, StudentName), Course(CourseID, CourseName, DeptID) 
Instructor(InstructorID, InstructorName, DeptID) Department(DeptID, DeptName),
Enrollment(StudentID, CourseID, InstructorID, Grade) 
 
Define primary and foreign keys appropriately. 
Concepts Covered: Normalization, DDL, Primary and Foreign Keys

 User Story 2 — Data Population and Joins As an academic coordinator, 
 I want to view student-course relationships and instructor assignments using SQL joins.

 Tasks: Insert sample records in each table (minimum 5 students, 5 courses, 3 instructors, 2 departments)
 Write queries for the following: 
 Retrieve a list of students with their enrolled course names and instructors.
 Display all courses along with their department names (use INNER JOIN).
 Retrieve all students and the courses they are enrolled in, including those who have not yet been assigned a grade (use LEFT JOIN)
 List instructors who currently have no students assigned (use RIGHT JOIN). Concepts Covered: DML, INNER/LEFT/RIGHT Joins
